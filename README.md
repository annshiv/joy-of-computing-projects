# joy-of-computing-projects
I am doing joy of computing course in NPTEL in 2020. This course contain many python projects. on here I posing my coding projects using that course tutorials.

**Week 1 - Week 3**

        - INRODUCTION TO PYTHON
      
**Week 4**

   <h6>Birthday paradox</h6>
      
      - this project randomly pick a month and year . then tell about leap year or not and then tell

   <h6> Magic square </h6>
   
      - In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers is called
      a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.
      The integer n (where n is the number of integers on a side) is the order of the magic square and the constant 
      sum is called the magic constant. If the array includes just the positive integers , the magic square is said to
      be normal.Some authors take magic square to mean normal magic square. this project is give 
      a square of n column and n row

**Week 5**

      - A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player

      scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[3]), but will lose to 
      one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a
      play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied
