   <h6> Magic square </h6>
   
      - In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.The integer n (where n is the number of integers on a side) is the order of the magic square and the constant sum is called the magic constant. If the array includes just the positive integers , the magic square is said to be normal. Some authors take magic square to mean normal magic square.
